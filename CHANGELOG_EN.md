# CHANGELOG

> [中文版 →](CHANGELOG.md)

This file records official PayDance releases and is the source of the GitHub Release notes.

Build artifacts and verification files are available in [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/MrBaoboer/PayDance/releases).

## Unreleased

- **EXE file properties**: the portable EXE now carries publisher, description, copyright, and license fields, visible in the Windows file properties panel.

## Released

### v0.9.9

- **Mini mode no longer occupies the taskbar**: entering mini floating mode drops the main window's taskbar button and leaving it restores the button; hiding to the tray and showing again re-drops it. The tray icon remains the way to bring the window back.
- **Custom currency symbol**: Settings gains a Currency symbol field — type whatever symbol you want ($, €, £, ₩, HK$), or leave it empty for no symbol at all, with a live `88.68` preview beside the field. The default is still ¥, and existing installs keep it. It applies to the dashboard, estimated daily earnings, salary details, the mini window, and the salary input unit, and a screen reader announces the same symbol. No exchange-rate conversion ([#30](https://github.com/MrBaoboer/PayDance/issues/30)).
- **Fixed off-screen window recovery never running in shipped builds**: a window stranded by an unplugged monitor was never pulled back. The `available_monitors` and `primary_monitor` commands the recovery depends on had no permission grant, so the monitor list stayed empty and the on-screen check always answered yes. The permissions are now granted, and a new test fails the build whenever the frontend calls a window command with no matching grant.
- **Fixed a destroyed main window leaving a zombie process**: closing the window with Alt+F4 or the taskbar context menu early in startup left an invisible process with an unresponsive tray, killable only from Task Manager. The titlebar "close to tray" button now really hides, the close interceptor registers as the first step of startup, and Rust exits cleanly if the main window is destroyed anyway.
- **Tray menu follows the language**: the tray menu and tooltip always started in Chinese and only changed after manually switching language in Settings; the language restored at startup, or auto-detected from the system on a first run, now reaches the tray too.
- **Mini opacity panel follows the language**: that panel is a separate window that never reads the settings file, so it was permanently Chinese. The main window now sends the current language when it opens the panel.
- **Accessibility fixes**: the accessible name of the dashboard button and of the mini window now carries the live amount — today's earnings were previously invisible to screen readers. Settings switches get their keyboard focus ring back after a blanket `outline: none` removed it.
- **Honours the system reduce-motion setting**: the looping progress-bar shine on the always-on-top window ignored the setting; it is now degraded globally.
- **Settings persistence gap**: the amount animation style, the UI language, and the currency symbol had no write trigger of their own, so an abnormal exit rolled them back. Each now schedules a save.
- **English punctuation**: the separator after Version and Author in the About section was a hardcoded Chinese fullwidth colon; it now follows the locale.

### v0.9.8

- **Fixed the window disappearing after a full-screen game**: Windows parks a minimized window at the sentinel position `-32000, -32000`, and that coordinate was being treated as a real position and written to `salary-settings.json`, stranding the window offscreen. The move event, the position capture, and the settings write now all reject it, and a coordinate poisoned by an older build is cleared as soon as settings are read on the next launch.
- **The tray and a second launch can always bring the window back**: `show()` does not un-minimize on Windows, so a window a full-screen game had minimized could not be recovered. The tray menu, a tray left-click, and re-running the app now un-minimize first and re-check that the window lands inside a visible monitor work area; a window that is already partly visible stays where the user put it.
- **Minimizing no longer affects the saved window size**: the collapsed client area reported while minimized, and zero-size readings, are both skipped.
- **Hardened settings against corrupt values**: window sizes now reject `NaN`, `Infinity`, and non-numeric content and are capped at a sane maximum, while coordinates also reject non-finite values and absurd magnitudes. A failure while applying the window mode at startup no longer aborts the rest of initialization, so the ticker, tray actions, and exit-save always register.
- **Guard for the window settings schema gate**: the version the window size compatibility check compares against is a different counter from the `settingsVersion` written to disk, so raising the former would reset every user's window size. It is now documented and covered by an ordering assertion.
- **Regression tests**: added coverage for the minimize sentinel, corrupt sizes, offscreen recovery, and tray un-minimize.
- **Website demo mode**: Web Preview now opens directly into the full wage dashboard with neutral demo salary, schedule, and preference defaults plus all seven workdays selected, without overwriting existing browser settings.
- **Onboarding remains available**: Web Preview Settings now includes a First-time setup action that reopens the existing three-step flow; Windows desktop first-run behavior is unchanged.

### v0.9.7

- **Language-first onboarding**: first-run setup now starts with usage preferences, then salary mode, then work time, so non-Chinese users can switch language on the first screen before entering salary and workday settings.
- **Independent Chinese and English website entries**: Chinese stays at `/PayDance/` and English now lives at `/PayDance/en/`. Each page has its own title, description, canonical URL, Open Graph metadata, and JSON-LD, connected by reciprocal hreflang links and a generated sitemap. Version and `dateModified` values are injected at build time.
- **Stable website refreshes**: Web Preview restores the saved theme before first paint and pauses color transitions until settings initialization finishes, preventing mixed light-page and black-control frames during refresh.
- **Dependency and CI baseline refresh**: Frontend dependencies move to their latest compatible versions; CI, CodeQL, and release workflows now use Node 24 and Windows 2025, while Pages artifact retrieval uses `actions/download-artifact` 8.0.1.
- **Faster daily pushes**: local push checks now cover metadata, formatting, lint, and unit tests, while GitHub CI handles slower builds, browser QA, Rust checks, and security audits. Formal releases still run the complete `npm run verify:release` path.
- **Maintenance foundation**: Renovate now runs immediately with unlimited concurrent PRs and human merge assessment; Web Preview has deterministic pixel-diff gates; Windows EXE smoke emits JSON evidence for window responsiveness and single-instance behavior.
- **Focused ownership**: the tray and portable-updater Rust code, Web Preview styles, and the Settings repository footer are split by responsibility. Web builds receive only the version string instead of the complete `package.json`.
- **Contributor navigation**: bilingual architecture change maps now connect common changes to files and checks, while starter issues require a user-visible result, evidence gathered before the change, acceptance criteria, and a verification command.

### v0.9.6

- **First-run fixes**: the mobile onboarding footer remains visible, and Web Preview always returns to the full dashboard instead of restoring the previous mini mode.
- **Silent settings self-repair**: a damaged value now resets only itself or the smallest linked group, preserving other valid preferences; repaired settings are written back without a persistent warning or automatically opening Settings.
- **Platform boundary**: Web Preview now uses browser-only storage, updater, and external-link adapters so its bundle does not pull in Tauri platform modules.
- **Rust regression tests**: cover update-version directory sanitization, Windows EXE recognition, spaced-path arguments, and install-directory write probes.
- **Release security**: added CodeQL, Windows EXE launch and single-instance smoke, SPDX SBOM generation, and full commit-SHA pinning for every GitHub Action.
- **Website SEO**: replaced the sharing image with a product-logo composition and reduced it from about 905 KB to about 45 KB; added a Windows desktop wage-dashboard title and corrected the structured-data category.

### v0.9.5

- **Independent full and mini window positions**: Each mode now saves and restores its own coordinates, so moving the mini window no longer overwrites the full window position.
- **Multi-monitor and DPI recovery fixes**: Window positions consistently use physical pixels and are validated against the actual primary monitor, per-monitor work areas, and scale factors, including left/right secondary displays, mixed scaling, taskbars, and disconnected-display fallback.
- **Mode-transition race fix**: The outgoing position is captured before resizing and the destination position snapshot is restored afterward, preventing resize events from contaminating the other mode's coordinates.
- **Regression coverage**: Added tests for mode transitions, independent positions, 150% DPI, negative secondary-monitor coordinates, and disconnected displays.

### v0.9.4

- **Desktop reliability hardening**: Hybrid clock recalibrates after long sleep or large system clock forward jumps while preserving monotonic earnings; window positions are clamped to visible monitor areas.
- **More trustworthy local settings**: Config migrations upgraded to explicit version chain; future-version configs are safely isolated; save failures now show a lightweight UI message instead of only console logs.
- **Updater and release-chain improvements**: Updater distinguishes missing dev config, production signature failures, invalid manifests, and network errors; Release dry-runs add a build-artifact smoke report, and post-release smoke no longer mistakes dry-runs for public Release verification.
- **Web Preview and accessibility**: Web Preview QA is enforced in CI; language switching syncs HTML `lang`; updater badges use semantic buttons.

### v0.9.3

- **License architecture reorganization**: Code license switched to AGPL-3.0-only; added AGPL §7 additional terms, trademark policy, brand asset license, project notice, third-party notices, and contributor license agreement; documentation license switched to CC BY-SA 4.0; README license section reorganized.
- **Removed NSIS installer**: Releases now publish only portable EXE + SHA256 + `.sig`; `latest.json` points to the portable direct download.
- **CI fix**: gitleaks switched from the broken `gitleaks/gitleaks-action@v2` path to a command-line installation, resolving Windows runner failures.

### v0.9.2

- **Sharing card improvements**: Added `og:image:alt`, `twitter:image:alt`, and richer JSON-LD metadata.
- **Supply-chain security**: CI added gitleaks, `cargo audit`, and `cargo deny check`.
- **Governance docs**: Added or refreshed SECURITY, CONTRIBUTING, TRADEMARK, ROADMAP, SUPPORT, and English mirrors.
- **README refresh**: Reflected bilingual UI and silent updater capabilities.
- **Web Preview language switcher**: Moved to the top-right and refined dark-mode styling.

- **Update badge state machine**: Added downloading and failed states with retry.
- **Exit persistence**: Tray exit now flushes frontend state before quitting.
- **Tray internationalization**: Locale changes rebuild the Rust tray menu and tooltip.
- **Onboarding simplification**: Removed always-on-top and mini-mode options from the third setup step.
- **Window position persistence**: Saves and restores main-window positions with safe fallback after monitor changes.
- **Web Preview language switcher**: Added Chinese / English switching.
- **Web Preview deployment gate**: Deploys only after CI succeeds.
- **Post-release smoke workflow**: Validates latest release, README downloads, and `latest.json`.
- **Updater restart fix**: Added `tauri-plugin-process` restart capability.
- **Governance docs and code hygiene**: Added governance material and refreshed accessibility/test assertions.
